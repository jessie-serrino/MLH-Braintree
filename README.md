BeaconCart
==========

BeaconCart was an application created at the MLH Launch Hackathon at PayPal UK. The app was worked on by four team members.

At the end of the hackathon, the app was awarded the PayPal prize.


#General Idea
The app's premise was simple: to create a payment method for customers to select and pay for items in stores that they were close to. Unlike GPS tracking, which can be costly on a phone, Estimote Beacon sensors were used to lightly inform the phone if it were near a proximity sensor. After the user selected their items, payments were processed through Braintree's API using either PayPal or credit card.
